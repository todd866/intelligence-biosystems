Editor and Reviewer comments:  

Reviewer #1: 1. The manuscript's abstract and introduction are conceptually rich but occasionally dense, with long sentences that obscure the logical flow. For example, the phrase "thermodynamically admissible yet temporally unresolvable regimes" could be clarified by briefly stating what makes a regime "admissible" in this context. Consider citing https://doi.org/10.58496/adsa/2023/009 to frame this clarification within broader discussions of interpretability and trustworthiness in complex AI systems, which similarly emphasize the need for accessible conceptual language.

2. In Section 2.1, the explanation of the temporal uncertainty relation would benefit from clearer transitions between physical assumptions and derived implications. The study titled *"Deep Transfer Learning Model for EEG Biometric Decoding"* discusses how signal interpretation depends on explicitly linking measurement constraints to observable outcomes—an approach that could guide the restructuring of your derivation for better readability and logical continuity.

3. The methodology—specifically, the decision to avoid explicit simulation or pseudocode—is philosophically consistent with the paper's thesis that sub-Landauer dynamics are unmeasurable. However, the paper would be strengthened by a clearer justification of how the proposed "feasibility bounds" were derived and validated. Consider citing https://doi.org/10.58496/bjai/2025/012, which outlines a modular and metacognitive framework for self-organizing systems; this reference supports methodological rigor in contexts where direct measurement is infeasible.

4. The paper's originality is notable: it reframes intelligence as a thermodynamic phenomenon constrained by measurement limits rather than algorithmic complexity. The study titled *"Artificial Intelligence of Things: A Review"* provides a useful contrast, as it situates intelligence within physically instantiated, sensor-rich systems. Drawing this comparison could help articulate how your framework extends beyond existing energy-information paradigms.

5. The argument occasionally shifts between physical formalism and philosophical inference without clear signposting. Adding brief summary sentences at the end of key subsections (e.g., after equations 1 and 2) would help readers track the conceptual progression from measurement limits to coherence-based computation.

6. The discussion of "dimensional collapse" would benefit from a schematic or conceptual diagram summarizing how unmeasurable dynamics transition into measurable outputs. This visual clarification would make the proposed mechanism more accessible to readers outside theoretical physics.

7. The literature context could be expanded slightly in the introduction to situate the work within thermodynamic computation or quantum measurement theory, even if only conceptually. Doing so would better highlight how the proposed "unmeasurable substrate" differs from prior models of sub-threshold computation.

8. Finally, the conclusion could more explicitly connect the theoretical predictions to empirical observables. Suggesting specific measurable macroscopic signatures (e.g., coherence decay rates or entropy production patterns) would make the paper's testability claim more concrete and compelling.


Reviewer #2: This manuscript presents a bold and unconventional theoretical framework proposing that intelligence arises from the maintenance of high-dimensional coherence within sub-Landauer thermodynamic regimes, where computation occurs below measurable thresholds. It unites ideas from thermodynamics, information theory, and nonlinear dynamics to argue that biological systems exploit unmeasurable, continuous relaxation processes to solve intractable problems such as vector addition system reachability.

The work is conceptually rich and elegantly written, but its claims are largely speculative and lack quantitative or empirical substantiation. The physical plausibility of sustained sub-Landauer computation and the proposed mechanisms for "dimensional collapse" require clearer experimental grounding. While the manuscript offers stimulating and original philosophical insight into the physical basis of intelligence, it would benefit from tighter linkage to measurable biological or computational phenomena to ensure scientific testability and relevance. Hence the evaluation result of major revision.

To strengthen it, the author could introduce at least one simple numerical or simulation model illustrating "dimensional collapse" or "continuous relaxation," identify measurable biological proxies (e.g., neural coherence times, stochastic resonance thresholds) for proposed mechanisms, and more clearly separate physical principles from conjecture. The thermodynamic arguments about sub-Landauer computation require precise energy definitions, and the consciousness section could be reframed as speculative. Clearer structure, integration of contemporary computational neuroscience literature, and a more operational conclusion emphasizing testable predictions would greatly enhance scientific credibility and readability.
