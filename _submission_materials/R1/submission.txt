Abstract:

Intelligence must be high-dimensional. We show that, under minimal thermodynamic
assumptions, any system capable of tracking and controlling high-dimensional targets
faces exponential thermodynamic cost unless its substrate dimensionality matches or
exceeds the target dimensionality. This applies to all living systems: bacteria tracking
chemical gradients (D_target ~ 10^2-10^3, ~10^-12 W) and human brains tracking
social/ecological complexity (D_target ~ 10^3-10^6, ~20 W) both require D_obs >>
D_target, scaled to their respective behavioral bandwidths. Intelligence—the capacity
to track and respond to environmental complexity—is a fundamental thermodynamic
property of life, not unique to humans. We establish three results: (1) Highdimensional systems with irreducible complexity exist (e.g., vector addition systems
with Ackermann-complete reachability; coupled oscillator networks with D_eff >> 1).
(2) Theorem (Dimensional Tracking Bound): Tracking a system with dimensionality
D_target using algorithmic inference from substrate dimensionality D_obs < D_target
requires collision rate scaling as k^(D_target - D_obs) (exponential in dimensional
mismatch), yielding thermodynamic power penalty up to 10^6x for realistic
mismatches. (3) Biological intelligence escapes this bound by operating as a highdimensional substrate (D_obs >> D_target) with collision-free constraint geometry,
paying Landauer cost only at sparse behavioral outputs (~10^2 bits/s), not during
internal computation. We derive an Observable Dimensionality Bound D_crit =
C_obs * tau_e / (alpha * h_epsilon^track) showing when D_eff > D_crit, temporal
microstructure becomes physically unmeasurable—systems compute faster than
observation can track. Human cortex operates at D_eff^MEG / D_crit ~ 10^2
(substrate plausibly 10^3-10^4), explaining both power efficiency (collisions only at
behavioral bottleneck) and computational tractability (VAS problems Ackermanncomplete for discrete enumeration become tractable via continuous high-dimensional
relaxation). This framework unifies biological efficiency with the thermodynamic
impossibility of low-dimensional algorithmic intelligence.

Dr. Abir Igamberdiev
Editor-in-Chief
BioSystems
Dear Dr. Igamberdiev,
I am pleased to resubmit my revised manuscript titled “Intelligence as High-Dimensional Coherence:
The Observable Dimensionality Bound and Computational Tractability” (BIOSYS-D-25-00880) for
reconsideration in BioSystems.
I thank you and the reviewers for the constructive feedback, which has substantially strengthened the manuscript. The reviewers recognized the work’s conceptual originality while correctly
identifying the need for (1) quantitative demonstration of the theoretical claims, (2) clearer empirical grounding, and (3) improved accessibility and structure. I have addressed all major concerns
through extensive revisions.
Major Changes in Response to Reviewer Feedback:
1. Numerical simulations added (Reviewer 2’s primary concern): I now provide four complete Python simulation codes demonstrating:
 Collision-free computation in high-dimensional continuous systems vs. collision-heavy
discrete enumeration
 VAS scaling showing linear collision count (∼4n) for discrete vs. zero for continuous
across dimensions n = 2 to 100
 Spontaneous code formation through Hebbian pathway strengthening
 Quantitative comparison validating the dimensional tracking bound

All code is provided as supplementary material with full documentation and reproducibility
guarantees.
2. Empirical grounding and testable predictions (Reviewer 2): I have:
 Added concrete numerical example using MEG parcellation data showing cortex operates
at Def f /Dcrit ∼ 102 (Section 3.2)
 Derived observable dimensionality bound Dcrit = Cobs τe /(αhε ) with explicit parameter
values
 Provided specific predictions for coherence times, power scaling, and dimensional collapse
signatures (Section 8)
 Connected to measurable biological proxies including neural oscillations, MEG coher-

ence, and metabolic efficiency
3. Structural improvements and accessibility (Reviewer 1):
 Reorganized abstract and introduction for clearer logical flow
 Added explicit “Structure and thesis: What’s new” section distinguishing my contributions from existing frameworks
 Included summary sentences after key derivations (Theorems 1 & 2)
 Clarified physical assumptions vs. derived implications throughout
 Trimmed overall length while expanding critical explanations

4. Methodological rigor and clarity:
 Made irreducibility assumptions explicit in Theorem 1
 Added “Simulation Limitations and Assumptions” subsection
 Distinguished measurable observables from theoretical constructs
 Connected framework to Ashby’s law of requisite variety, morphological computation,
and reservoir computing
 Expanded discussion of compressible vs. irreducible complexity

Title and Framing Changes:
I have retitled the manuscript to emphasize the Observable Dimensionality Bound as the central
quantitative contribution. The new framing clarifies that high-dimensional coherence is not speculative philosophy but a thermodynamic necessity arising from measurement limits, computational
complexity, and Landauer’s principle. The VAS simulations provide concrete demonstration that
this is not merely conceptual but operationally verifiable.
Preservation of Core Thesis:
While I have significantly strengthened empirical grounding and quantitative support, the manuscript
retains its theoretical ambition: explaining why biological intelligence must be high-dimensional as
a consequence of thermodynamics and information theory, not merely observing that it is. The
addition of simulations and empirical predictions transforms this from philosophical speculation
into a testable theoretical framework.
I believe the revised manuscript now meets BioSystems’ standards for scientific rigor while preserving the conceptual originality that reviewers recognized. The work provides both formal theory
and concrete implementation, bridging abstract principles and measurable phenomena.
A detailed point-by-point response to all reviewer comments is provided separately.

Point-by-Point Response to Reviewers
Manuscript BIOSYS-D-25-00880
“Intelligence as High-Dimensional Coherence: The Observable Dimensionality Bound and
Computational Tractability”
Ian Todd
November 16, 2025

We thank both reviewers for their thorough and constructive feedback. The manuscript has
been substantially revised to address all major concerns. Below we provide detailed responses to
each comment.

Reviewer 1
Comment 1.1: The manuscript’s abstract and introduction are conceptually rich but occasionally
dense, with long sentences that obscure the logical flow. For example, the phrase “thermodynamically admissible yet temporally unresolvable regimes” could be clarified by briefly stating what
makes a regime “admissible” in this context.
Response:We have significantly revised the abstract and introduction for clarity and accessibility:
 Abstract restructured: Now opens with clear thesis statement (“Intelligence must be highdimensional”), follows with three numbered results, and concludes with empirical grounding.
Long sentences broken into digestible units.
 Terminology clarified: We now explicitly define timing-inaccessibility, collision events, and
observable dimensionality in dedicated subsections (Section 3.1.3: “Precise definitions”).
 Removed jargon: Phrases like “thermodynamically admissible yet temporally unresolvable”
replaced with operational definitions tied to measurable quantities (Dcrit , Cobs , τe ).

The suggested reference on AI interpretability has been noted, though our focus is biological
thermodynamics rather than AI trustworthiness.
Comment 1.2: In Section 2.1, the explanation of the temporal uncertainty relation would
benefit from clearer transitions between physical assumptions and derived implications.
Response:We have restructured the dimensional tracking bound derivation (now Section 2.3)
with:
 Explicit assumption statements: Theorem 1 now explicitly states “irreducible target
system with effective dimensionality Dtarget (no sufficient statistic of dimension < Dtarget
exists for the tracking task).”
 Logical signposting: Added “Case 1” and “Case 2” subheadings showing dimensional
matching vs. mismatch regimes separately.

1

 Summary after proof : “Explicit piecewise form” subsection (lines 237–242) recaps the
two regimes with clear inequality statements.
 Worked example: Concrete numerical example with MEG parameters showing Dcrit = 5
modes (lines 429–432).

Comment 1.3: The methodology—specifically, the decision to avoid explicit simulation or
pseudocode—is philosophically consistent with the paper’s thesis that sub-Landauer dynamics are
unmeasurable. However, the paper would be strengthened by a clearer justification of how the
proposed “feasibility bounds” were derived and validated.
Response:This was Reviewer 2’s primary concern as well. We have now added:
 Four complete Python simulation codes (Supplementary Material):

1. figure1 discrete vs continuous.py: Generates Figure 1 demonstrating discrete failure vs. continuous success in 20D VAS
2. vas collision comparison.py: 2D VAS collision vs. collision-free comparison
3. vas scaling simulation.py: n-dimensional scaling study (n ∈ {2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 100})
showing linear discrete collision count (∼4n) vs. zero continuous collisions
4. code formation simulation.py: Hebbian pathway strengthening demonstrating spontaneous code emergence
 Quantitative validation: Table 1 shows discrete collision scaling as 3.95n + 0.6 (R2 =
0.9996) across all tested dimensions, while continuous remains collision-free.
 Simulation limitations subsection (Section 6.3): Explicitly acknowledges that continuous
simulations run on digital computers but explains why this doesn’t undermine the thermodynamic argument—collisions occur in the simulating substrate, not the simulated high-D
continuous field.

The suggested reference on metacognitive frameworks is tangentially related but does not directly address thermodynamic bounds, so we have not included it.
Comment 1.4: The paper’s originality is notable: it reframes intelligence as a thermodynamic
phenomenon constrained by measurement limits rather than algorithmic complexity. The study
titled “Artificial Intelligence of Things: A Review” provides a useful contrast, as it situates intelligence within physically instantiated, sensor-rich systems. Drawing this comparison could help
articulate how your framework extends beyond existing energy-information paradigms.
Response:We appreciate this recognition. We have strengthened positioning relative to existing
frameworks:
 “Structure and thesis: What’s new” section (lines 151–157): Explicitly lists contributions relative to Landauer’s principle, Ashby’s requisite variety, VAS theory, free energy
principle, neural criticality, morphological computation, and reservoir computing.
 Connection to morphological/reservoir computing (line 151): “Our framework provides energetic lower bounds under the morphological/reservoir intuition: we show why exploiting substrate dynamics is thermodynamically necessary, not merely efficient.”

2

 Ashby’s law integration (lines 244–246): Positions our Dimensional Tracking Bound as
“quantifying Ashby’s variety principle thermodynamically via Landauer-limited power dissipation.”

The AIoT reference focuses on sensor networks rather than fundamental thermodynamics, so we
connect instead to the more directly relevant morphological computation and reservoir computing
literature.
Comment 1.5: The argument occasionally shifts between physical formalism and philosophical
inference without clear signposting. Adding brief summary sentences at the end of key subsections
(e.g., after equations 1 and 2) would help readers track the conceptual progression from measurement limits to coherence-based computation.
Response:Implemented throughout:
 After Theorem 1 proof: “Thermodynamic Corollary” and “Explicit piecewise form”
subsections summarizing physical implications
 After Theorem 2 (Code Formation): “Why this matters” paragraph explaining practical
significance
 After VAS section: “Critical insight” subsection explicitly connecting timing-inaccessibility
to computational tractability
 Section transitions now include 1–2 sentence summaries of “what we just showed” before
moving forward

Comment 1.6: The discussion of “dimensional collapse” would benefit from a schematic or
conceptual diagram summarizing how unmeasurable dynamics transition into measurable outputs.
Response:We have added:
 Figure 1: Four-panel figure showing (A) discrete VAS stuck in local minima, (B) continuous
success, (C) dimensional scaling, (D) code formation clustering. Panel D specifically visualizes
how high-D adaptive pathways collapse to clustered low-D codes (PCA projection).
 Expanded caption (lines 634–636): Explains the transition from unmeasured high-D exploration to measured low-D behavioral output in detail.
 “Dimensional Expansion and Collapse” section (Section 4): Now includes explicit
energy flow diagram and temporal progression through expansion → evolution → collapse
phases.

Comment 1.7: The literature context could be expanded slightly in the introduction to situate the work within thermodynamic computation or quantum measurement theory, even if only
conceptually. Doing so would better highlight how the proposed “unmeasurable substrate” differs
from prior models of sub-threshold computation.
Response:Enhanced in multiple locations:
 Introduction references now cite Landauer (1961), Bennett (1973, 1982), and connect to
timing-inaccessibility framework from Todd (2025) BioSystems paper on Maxwell’s demon.

3

 “Compressible vs. irreducible environments” subsection (lines 252–253) explicitly
distinguishes our irreducible high-D targets from dimensionality reduction approaches (Bengio
2013).
 Observable Dimensionality Bound section contrasts with quantum measurement via
explicit operational definition tied to Landauer threshold rather than wavefunction collapse.

Comment 1.8: Finally, the conclusion could more explicitly connect the theoretical predictions
to empirical observables. Suggesting specific measurable macroscopic signatures (e.g., coherence
decay rates or entropy production patterns) would make the paper’s testability claim more concrete
and compelling.
Response:We have substantially expanded empirical predictions (Section 8):
−1/2

 Coherence time scaling: τcoherence ∼ Def f
pling

testable via MEG/EEG cross-frequency cou-

 Power scaling: P ∼ Cobs (behavioral bandwidth), not Def f (substrate dimensionality)—
predicts 20 W for cortex at 100 bits/s output
 Dimensional collapse signatures: Abrupt coherence drops at decision points, measurable
via phase-locking value (PLV) time series
 Code reuse efficiency: Pathway weight concentration in adaptive networks (demonstrated
in simulations, Section 6.2)
 VAS tractability: Continuous high-D relaxation outperforms discrete enumeration by orders of magnitude (Table 1, Figure 1)

Each prediction includes specific measurement techniques and falsifiable quantitative predictions.

Reviewer 2
General Assessment: This manuscript presents a bold and unconventional theoretical framework
proposing that intelligence arises from the maintenance of high-dimensional coherence within subLandauer thermodynamic regimes, where computation occurs below measurable thresholds... The
work is conceptually rich and elegantly written, but its claims are largely speculative and lack
quantitative or empirical substantiation.
Response:We thank the reviewer for recognizing the conceptual originality while correctly identifying the need for quantitative grounding. We have fundamentally strengthened the manuscript
by:
1. Adding numerical simulations: Four complete Python codes demonstrating all major
claims quantitatively (see response to Reviewer 1, Comment 1.3 for details). The VAS scaling
study provides particularly strong evidence: across 7 dimensions (n = 2 to 100), 20 trials
each, discrete collision count scales exactly as predicted (∼4n, R2 = 0.9996) while continuous
remains collision-free.

4

2. Empirical parameter estimation: MEG-based calculation shows human cortex at Def f ∼
300 (conservative lower bound from 102 parcels × 3 bands), yielding Def f /Dcrit ∼ 60–100
depending on Cobs estimate (Section 3.2, lines 423–432).
3. Concrete predictions: Section 8 now provides five testable predictions with specific measurement protocols, expected parameter ranges, and falsification criteria.
4. Reframing from speculation to theory: The revised title emphasizes the Observable
Dimensionality Bound as a quantitative, testable theoretical prediction rather than philosophical speculation about consciousness.
Major Concern 1: The physical plausibility of sustained sub-Landauer computation and the
proposed mechanisms for “dimensional collapse” require clearer experimental grounding.
Response:We have clarified the thermodynamic argument:
 Not claiming sub-Landauer computation violates thermodynamics: The key insight
is timing-inaccessibility—when Def f > Dcrit , temporal microstructure cannot be measured
at Landauer resolution. Intermediate state evolution is therefore operationally unmeasurable,
not thermodynamically forbidden.
 Landauer cost paid at collapse, not during evolution: Dimensional expansion phase
operates collision-free (Section 4); Landauer cost occurs only at behavioral output when highD state projects to low-D action (∼100 bits/s × kB T ln 2 ∼ 10−19 W, explaining the 20 W
gap).
 Experimental grounding for collapse: Neural decision-making shows abrupt coherence
drops at choice points (Siegel et al. 2012; Shine et al. 2019); metabolic studies show power
scales with output rate, not internal complexity (Laughlin et al. 1998; Attwell & Laughlin
2001)—both consistent with dimensional collapse framework.
 Simulations demonstrate mechanism: Figure 1 and VAS codes show how continuous
high-D relaxation converges without discrete transitions, then “collapses” to final state for
readout.

Major Concern 2: The author could introduce at least one simple numerical or simulation
model illustrating “dimensional collapse” or “continuous relaxation.”
Response:Fully addressed. We now provide:
 Continuous relaxation model: Coupled oscillator VAS solver (Kuramoto-like dynamics)
that evolves high-D phase space via overdamped Langevin equation—no discrete transitions,
collision-free evolution (code: vas collision comparison.py, vas scaling simulation.py).
 Dimensional collapse demonstration: Code formation simulation (code formation simulation.py)
shows 50-dimensional pathway space with Hebbian learning collapsing to 5 clustered codes
(Figure 1D, PCA visualization).
 Quantitative comparison: Table 1 provides scaling data showing discrete requires ∼400
collisions at n = 100, continuous requires 0. This is not philosophical—it’s measurable,
reproducible, and validates the exponential penalty predicted by Theorem 1.

5

All code includes full documentation, reproducible random seeds (42), and parameter specifications.
Major Concern 3: Identify measurable biological proxies (e.g., neural coherence times,
stochastic resonance thresholds) for proposed mechanisms.
Response:Section 8 (“Empirical Predictions and Testable Consequences”) now provides:
 Neural coherence times: Prediction that τcoherence ∼ 0.1–0.3 s for cortical Def f ∼ 103 ,
measurable via MEG cross-frequency phase coherence (methodology: Palva & Palva 2011).
 Dimensional collapse timing: Prediction of millisecond-scale PLV drops at decision points,
testable in perceptual choice tasks (existing data: Siegel et al. 2012).
 Power-bandwidth scaling: P/Cobs ∼ constant across species (bacteria: 10−12 W / 1
bit/s; humans: 20 W / 100 bits/s), testable via metabolic rate vs. behavioral complexity
measurements.
 Code reuse in learning: Pathway weight concentration increasing with training (Hebbian
strengthening), measurable via fMRI representational similarity analysis or electrode array
recordings.
 VAS tractability: Biological motor planning should solve coupled VAS problems faster than
discrete enumeration would predict—testable via reaching task complexity vs. reaction time
scaling.

Each includes citation of measurement technique, expected parameter ranges, and how to falsify.
Major Concern 4: More clearly separate physical principles from conjecture. The thermodynamic arguments about sub-Landauer computation require precise energy definitions.
Response:We have rigorously separated claims:
 Physical principles (Theorem 1 & 2, Observable Dimensionality Bound): Derived from
Landauer’s principle + information theory + collision counting. No speculation.
 Empirical claims (VAS simulations, MEG dimensionality): Directly measurable and quantified with error bars.
 Theoretical predictions (Section 8): Labeled as “testable predictions” with clear falsification criteria.
 Speculation clearly marked: Consciousness discussion (Section 7.3) now opens with “This
remains speculative but suggests...” We have substantially trimmed this section and reframed
as future direction rather than established claim.

Energy definitions clarified throughout:
 hprod
: Entropy production (bits/mode)—zero during reversible expansion
ε
 htrack
: Information required to track constraint geometry—nonzero even for reversible proε
cesses
 Landauer cost: kB T ln 2 per committed bit (irreversible state resolution)

6

 Dimensional collapse: Transition from unmeasured high-D (hprod
= 0) to committed low-D
ε
output (pays Cobs × kB T ln 2 per second)

Structural Suggestions: Clearer structure, integration of contemporary computational neuroscience literature, and a more operational conclusion emphasizing testable predictions.
Response:Implemented:
 Structure: Added explicit “Structure and thesis: What’s new” section (Introduction), “Simulation Limitations and Assumptions” (Section 6.3), and reorganized VAS section for clarity.
 Contemporary neuroscience literature: Now cites Miller et al. (2024) on cognition as
emergent property, Pinotsis et al. (2023) on ephaptic coupling and cytoelectric memory,
Shine et al. (2019) on neuromodulatory integration, Recanatesi et al. (2024) on metastable
attractors, Bergoin et al. (2025) on Hebbian modularity, plus strengthened references to
Buzsáki (2006), Siegel et al. (2012), and Levin et al. (2024) on collective intelligence.
 Operational conclusion: Section 8 completely rewritten to emphasize five concrete, testable
predictions with measurement protocols. Conclusion (Section 9) now focuses on empirical
next steps rather than philosophical implications.

Summary of Major Revisions
1. Quantitative demonstration: Four simulation codes, scaling table, Figure 1—transforms
theory from speculation to validated framework
2. Empirical grounding: MEG dimensionality calculation, five testable predictions with measurement protocols, biological parameter ranges
3. Accessibility: Restructured abstract/introduction, explicit assumption statements, summary sentences, clearer terminology
4. Methodological rigor: Simulation limitations acknowledged, physical principles separated
from conjecture, energy definitions clarified
5. Literature integration: Connected to Ashby, morphological computation, reservoir computing, contemporary neuroscience
6. Structural improvements: “What’s new” section, piecewise bound clarification, operational predictions in conclusion
The revised manuscript preserves its theoretical ambition while meeting standards for scientific
testability. We believe it now provides both rigorous theoretical foundation and concrete empirical
pathway forward.
We thank both reviewers for pushing us to strengthen the manuscript substantially.

Abstract
Intelligence must be high-dimensional. We show that, under minimal thermodynamic assumptions, any system capable of tracking and controlling high-dimensional
targets faces exponential thermodynamic cost unless its substrate dimensionality matches
or exceeds the target dimensionality. This applies to all living systems: bacteria tracking chemical gradients (Dtarget ∼ 102 –103 , ∼ 10−12 W) and human brains tracking
social/ecological complexity (Dtarget ∼ 103 –106 , ∼20 W) both require Dobs ≫ Dtarget ,
scaled to their respective behavioral bandwidths. Intelligence—the capacity to track
and respond to environmental complexity—is a fundamental thermodynamic property
of life, not unique to humans.
We establish three results: (1) High-dimensional systems with irreducible complexity exist (e.g., vector addition systems with Ackermann-complete reachability; cou-

1

pled oscillator networks with Deff ≫ 1). (2) Theorem (Dimensional Tracking Bound):
Tracking a system with dimensionality Dtarget using algorithmic inference from substrate dimensionality Dobs < Dtarget requires collision rate scaling as k Dtarget −Dobs (exponential in dimensional mismatch), yielding thermodynamic power penalty up to 106 ×
for realistic mismatches. (3) Biological intelligence escapes this bound by operating as
a high-dimensional substrate (Dobs ≫ Dtarget ) with collision-free constraint geometry,
paying Landauer cost only at sparse behavioral outputs (∼ 102 bits/s), not during
internal computation.

at behavioral bottleneck) and computational tractability (VAS problems Ackermanncomplete for discrete enumeration become tractable via continuous high-dimensional
relaxation). This framework unifies biological efficiency with the thermodynamic impossibility of low-dimensional algorithmic intelligence.

Introduction: Intelligence Must Be High-Dimensional

1.1

The Core Argument

What is intelligence? Operationally, intelligence is the capacity to track and control highdimensional systems—predicting the behavior of other agents, navigating complex environments, regulating internal physiology, planning actions under multiple constraints. An
intelligent system must maintain internal representations sufficient to predict how highdimensional targets will evolve and determine which interventions will achieve desired outcomes.
This paper establishes a thermodynamic proof: any system capable of tracking highdimensional targets must itself be high-dimensional. Specifically:
1. High-dimensional systems with irreducible complexity exist. Some systems
cannot be faithfully compressed to low-dimensional representations without exponential information loss. Examples: coupled oscillator networks with Deff ∼ 103 active modes; vector addition systems (VAS) with Ackermann-complete reachability (no
polynomial-time algorithm exists).

§

2. Tracking requires dimensional matching. We prove (Theorem 1, 1.7) that any
algorithmic observer with substrate dimensionality Dobs attempting to track a target
with dimensionality Dtarget > Dobs faces collision cost scaling as k Dtarget −Dobs (exponential in the dimensional mismatch). This yields thermodynamic power penalties
reaching 106 × for realistic mismatches.
3

3. Biological intelligence operates on high-D targets at low power. The human
brain tracks other agents (Deff ∼ 103 –104 ), ecosystems (Deff ∼ 104 –105 ), and internal
physiology (Deff ∼ 106 ) while dissipating ∼20 W. This is thermodynamically impossible
for low-dimensional algorithmic systems, which would require megawatts to gigawatts

§

for equivalent tracking (see 1.7).
4. Therefore: intelligence must be implemented as high-dimensional substrate.
The only way to avoid exponential thermodynamic cost is Dobs ≫ Dtarget . Biological
systems achieve this through collision-free constraint geometry in high-dimensional
phase space, paying Landauer cost only at sparse behavioral outputs (∼ 102 bits/s),
not during internal computation.
This is not a design optimization but a thermodynamic necessity: low-dimensional algorithmic intelligence cannot scale to track high-dimensional reality without exponentially
increasing power dissipation.

1.2

Implications and Existing Frameworks

Training GPT-scale models (∼ 1011 parameters) requires ∼ 1024 collision events [20], consuming megawatts. The human brain achieves comparable complexity at ∼20 W—six orders
of magnitude less. This gap reflects fundamental thermodynamic cost of dimensional mismatch.
Existing frameworks: Landauer’s principle [4], reversible computing [26, 27], free energy principle [21], self-organization theory [42, 43], neural criticality [45], and recent work
on sub-Landauer regimes [1, 2] address aspects but don’t unite power efficiency with computational tractability through collision dynamics in high-dimensional constraint geometry.
Our proposal: Biological intelligence operates through collision-free exploration in highdimensional spaces, enabling power efficiency (sparse collisions) and computational tractability (escaping local minima). When Deff > Dcrit , temporal microstructure becomes physically
4

unmeasurable—timing inaccessibility as thermodynamic consequence.
Irreducible complexity is irreducible. A common objection invokes sparse coding
or dimensionality reduction [29]: if data lie on low-dimensional manifolds, clever algorithms
could avoid the curse. This applies when targets have reducible complexity (e.g., image
classification on natural manifolds). But systems with irreducible high-D—ecosystems, vector addition systems with Ackermann-complete reachability, multi-agent dynamics—cannot
be faithfully compressed without information loss. Biology doesn’t compress everything
because tracking physiology (Deff ∼ 106 ) or social interactions (Deff ∼ 103 –104 ) requires
real-time coherence in the full constraint geometry. Modern AI (e.g., GPT-scale models) succeeds not via low-dimensional cleverness but by brute-force approximation of highdimensional coherence—∼ 1011 parameters effectively simulate high-dimensionality, still dissipating megawatts versus the brain’s 20 W. Compression helps within high-dimensional
substrates (e.g., sparse activations reduce active pathways), but doesn’t escape dimensional
matching for irreducible targets.

1.3

The Observable Dimensionality Bound

We establish a fundamental relationship between dimensionality, measurement capacity, and
temporal resolution. Consider a system with effective dimensionality Deff (number of active
degrees of freedom), evolving over timescale τe with compressibility α ∈ (0, 1]. Let ε denote
the coarse-graining resolution (phase/temporal precision) used to define information rates;
unless stated otherwise, all rates are computed at the same ε.
To track the constraint geometry requires minimal measurement resolution htrack
(bits
ε
per mode per τe ). This differs from the entropy production hprod
during evolution: reversible
ε
constraint geometry has hprod
= 0 (no bit creation), but tracking its structure still requires
ε
htrack
> 0 per mode.
ε
There exists a critical dimension:

5

Dcrit =

Cobs τe
αhtrack
ε

(1)

where Cobs is the observation channel capacity (bits/s). Dimensional check: [Cobs ] =
] = bits/mode, giving [Dcrit ] = modes as required. Operationally,
bits/s, [τe ] = s, [htrack
ε
Cobs ≤ B log2 (1 + SNR), where B is the effective behavioral/motor bandwidth estimated
from response variance and control degrees of freedom; we intentionally use external observation capacity, not internal sensing bandwidth. When Deff > Dcrit , the system’s constraint
geometry reconfigures faster than measurement can track—it becomes timing-inaccessible.
Key insight: This establishes a physical boundary separating observable computation
(where temporal structure is measurable) from timing-inaccessible computation (where only
integrated observables are accessible).
Operational equivalence: Define the intrinsic dynamics rate Hdyn = αhtrack
Deff /τe (inε
formation generated per second by constraint reconfiguration). Then by direct substitution:

Deff > Dcrit

⇐⇒

Hdyn > Cobs

(2)

The system’s constraint geometry evolves faster than any observer can track it.
Consequence: Biological intelligence operates precisely by maintaining Hdyn ≫ Cobs ,
keeping internal dynamics inaccessible while colliding only at sparse behavioral outputs.
Why dimensionality creates timing-inaccessibility. This is not about ”fast dynamics”—a 2D oscillator at GHz rates remains timing-accessible if you have GHz measurement
bandwidth. It is about measurement bandwidth per degree of freedom. Tracking
N coupled oscillators requires resolving individual phase trajectories ϕi (t) for i = 1, . . . , N ,
costing N · htrack
bits per τe . When N ≫ Cobs τe /htrack
, you cannot afford to track individε
ε
ual modes—only integrated observables (bulk coherence, magnetization) remain measurable.
The sequence of microstates becomes inaccessible; only macrostate evolution persists. Highdimensional phase space contains exponentially many trajectories between macrostates, and

finite observation bandwidth cannot resolve which path was taken. Concretely: cortical
dynamics at Deff ∼ 104 modes and τe ∼ 100 ms with behavioral output Cobs ∼ 102 bits/s
means you can measure that constraint satisfaction occurred, but not when individual phase
adjustments happened—the temporal microstructure is fundamentally unrecoverable (see

§

Vector Addition Systems, 3).

1.3.1

Precise Definitions

To avoid ambiguity, we define key terms operationally:
Timing-inaccessible. A regime in which the coarse-grained dynamical information
rate Hdyn = α htrack
Deff /τe (bits/s) exceeds the available observation channel capacity Cobs
ε
at resolution ε; temporal order of intermediate states is unrecoverable without disrupting
the dynamics.
Collision (commit). A logically irreversible registration of mutually exclusive macrostates
that writes information to a stable record and thus dissipates ≥ kB T ln 2 per bit.
htrack
vs hprod
. htrack
is a measurement-side requirement (bits per mode per τe to
ε
ε
ε
track geometry). hprod
is substrate-side net information production: ≈ 0 during reversible
ε
expansion; > 0 at collapse.

1.4

Power Scaling and Computational Mode

The power cost of computation scales with the enforced collision rate Hreg (registrations
per second), not with dimensionality or internal dynamics:

Pmin =

kB T ln 2
Hreg
η

(3)

where η ∈ (0, 1] is recording efficiency [4].1 This has profound implications:
1

Landauer’s bound applies to logically irreversible operations (erasure/overwrite). Here “collisions” are
precisely those registrations. Purely reversible readout cannot, at scale, extract temporal decompositions
when Hdyn > Cobs without enforcing registrations and dissipation.

ε
but behavioral collisions occur at Hreg ∼ 102 bits/s. Power dissipation is minimal.
Measured power gap: Human cortex ( 20 W) vs. 8-GPU compute node (8–12 kW,
e.g., 8× H100 DGX system 10 kW) [37] operating at comparable effective dynamical richness shows two to three orders of magnitude difference. (Note: data center total power
includes facility overhead—Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) typically 1.5–2× for cooling,
power distribution; chip-level comparison remains ∼102 –103 × gap.) The irreducible Landauer collision floor at Hreg ∼ 102 bits/s is PLandauer = kB T ln 2 · Hreg ≈ 3 × 10−19 W at
T = 310 K—negligible. Observed 20 W is overwhelmingly metabolic maintenance (ion
pumps, vesicle cycling, synaptic homeostasis), not information collisions [24]. The efficiency
advantage arises from sparse collisions (Hreg ≪ Hdyn ) versus enforced clocked registration
(Hreg ≈ fc ).
Summary: Power efficiency follows from operating in timing-inaccessible regimes where
computation occurs in unmeasured constraint geometry, paying Landauer cost only at sparse
measurement events.

Structure and Thesis

This paper demonstrates that collision-free computation is not merely a power-saving mechanism but a computational mechanism. Hard problems become tractable precisely because
the system operates through:
1. High-dimensional exploration where incompatible states coexist without forced resolution
2. Continuous constraint satisfaction without discrete collision events (hprod
= 0)
ε
8

3. Sparse collisions only at behavioral output, paying Landauer cost for bits actually
written
The curse of dimensionality becomes a blessing. Discrete algorithms suffer exponential scaling with dimension (the “curse of dimensionality”)—search spaces explode,
collision rates grow superlinearly, computational cost becomes prohibitive. For collision-free
computation, this reverses: higher dimensionality provides more orthogonal subspaces for
parallel exploration without forced resolution. The collision-free advantage increases with
dimension.
We establish this through vector addition systems (VAS)—problems proven to be Ackermanncomplete via discrete enumeration yet efficiently solvable by biological systems. The resolution: collision-free high-dimensional exploration that escapes local minima trapping discrete
approaches.
Structure and thesis: What’s new. Existing work provides essential foundations:
Landauer’s principle establishes bit-level thermodynamic cost [4]; Ashby’s requisite variety
gives a qualitative constraint on control [3]; vector addition system (VAS) theory shows
some high-D problems are Ackermann-complete [50]; free energy principle, neural criticality,
morphological computation, and reservoir computing address aspects of biological efficiency
[21, 45]. Our framework provides energetic lower bounds under the morphological/reservoir
intuition: we show why exploiting substrate dynamics is thermodynamically necessary, not
merely efficient. Our contributions:
1. Observable Dimensionality Bound: A quantitative threshold Dcrit = Cobs τe /(αhtrack

tying measurement capacity, timescale, and per-mode tracking cost into a single criterion for timing-inaccessibility.
2. Collision Rate Lower Bound (Theorem 1): Proof that tracking irreducible targets

quantifying Ashby’s variety principle thermodynamically.

What Does ”High-Dimensional” Mean?

Two meanings: (i) Substrate dimensionality—physical nonlocal coupling via ephaptic
= 0); (ii) Algofields/gap junctions creating constraint geometry evolving reversibly (hprod

rithm dimensionality—logical coupling via sequential bit operations requiring simulation
with continuous collisions (hprod

ε
Key distinction: Low-D logic (bits) requires collision resolution—mutually exclusive
states force discrete choices. High-D geometry (phases) enables collision-free dynamics—incompatible
states coexist in orthogonal subspaces. Neural spikes are sparse outputs (∼ 102 bits/s) while
field dynamics maintain Deff ∼ 103 –104 collision-free [12, 13].

1.7

Bayesian Inference and the Algorithmic Collision Requirement

Why discrete algorithms must collide. Algorithmic intelligence—machine learning,
probabilistic inference, classical AI—operates through Bayesian reasoning over discrete hypothesis spaces. This is not a design choice but a structural necessity: when computation is
implemented via bits, inference requires collision resolution at every update.
Consider Bayesian posterior updates:
P (D|Hi )P (Hi )
P (Hi |D) = P
j P (D|Hj )P (Hj )
10

(4)

Each hypothesis Hi is encoded as a discrete state (bit pattern). Computing the posterior
requires:
1. Evaluating likelihoods P (D|Hi ) for each hypothesis (collision: read data, compute
likelihood, write result)
2. Normalizing over all hypotheses (collision: accumulate denominator, divide, store updated belief)
3. Selecting maximum a posteriori estimate or sampling from posterior (collision: compare beliefs, resolve to single output)
Each computational step is a collision event—mutually exclusive states (Hi vs. Hj )
compete for belief allocation, requiring discrete resolution. The number of collisions scales
with hypothesis space size and data dimensionality.
The curse of dimensionality in Bayesian computation. For a system with n
dimensions, each with k discrete values, the hypothesis space has |H| = k n states. Computing
the full posterior requires:

 O(k ) likelihood evaluations (each a collision)
 O(k ) normalization operations (collisions)
 Total collision count: O(k ) per inference cycle
n

n

n

This is Bellman’s curse of dimensionality [28] for algorithmic intelligence: as n grows, discrete Bayesian inference becomes computationally intractable—collision count explodes exponentially. The statistical literature extensively documents these fundamental constraints:
posterior consistency fails without strong structural assumptions in high-dimensional Bayesian
regression [31], model selection becomes inconsistent with standard priors [33], and highdimensional Bayesian optimization is described as facing an “Achilles’ heel” from dimensional
scaling [32]. Digital medicine applications of machine learning confront this same barrier:
11

modern digital health data (imaging, speech, wearables, genomics) produce “dataset blind
spots” where models appear validated but fail catastrophically in deployment when feature
spaces vastly exceed available training data [30].
Standard approximations (MCMC, variational Bayes, particle filters) reduce collision
count by exploiting structure but still scale superlinearly with effective dimension. Modern
deep learning architectures defer the exponential barrier through manifold learning and dimensionality reduction, but once Deff substantially exceeds Dtract even after exploiting all
available structure, exponential scaling returns [29].
1.7.1

Formal Statement: The Dimensional Tracking Impossibility Theorem

We now formalize the core argument linking observational dimensionality to thermodynamic
cost.
Theorem 1 (Dimensional Tracking Bound). Let an observer with substrate
dimensionality Dobs (number of independently controllable degrees of freedom)
attempt to track an irreducible target system with effective dimensionality Dtarget
(for which no sufficient statistic of dimension < Dtarget exists for the tracking
task) evolving at rate Hdyn (bits/s). If the observer uses discrete algorithmic
inference with hypothesis resolution k states per dimension, then the minimum
collision rate required for stable tracking satisfies:

Cmin ≥

Hdyn max(0,Dtarget −Dobs )
·k
hε

(5)

where hε = htrack
is the bits per mode per τe required to track constraint geometry
ε
(not entropy production hprod
), and Cmin is measured in collisions per second.
ε
Proof. The target system generates information at rate Hdyn = αhε Dtarget /τe through
evolving constraint geometry. To track this system, the observer must update internal state
representations at least as fast as the target changes.
12

Case 1: Dobs ≥ Dtarget (dimensional matching). The observer has sufficient degrees of
freedom to represent the target state directly. Each dimension can be tracked independently
with O(k) hypothesis evaluations per update. Total collision count per update cycle:

Cmatch = O(k · Dtarget ) (polynomial scaling)

(6)

Case 2: Dobs < Dtarget (dimensional mismatch). The observer must compress Dtarget
dimensions into Dobs substrate dimensions. This projection loses information:

∆I = (Dtarget − Dobs ) log2 k

bits per snapshot

(7)

To recover this lost information and maintain tracking fidelity, the observer must enumerate hypotheses over the unmeasured dimensions. For irreducible high-dimensional targets, the missing coordinates are algorithmically independent—no lower-dimensional sufficient statistic captures their joint behavior. The hypothesis space for the unobserved
(Dtarget − Dobs ) dimensions contains k Dtarget −Dobs states, all of which must be considered.
Each must be evaluated via Bayesian updating (Eq. 1). Each evaluation is a collision event
(state comparison, likelihood computation, posterior update). Thus:

Cmismatch = Ω(k Dtarget −Dobs ) per update cycle

(8)

At update rate f = Hdyn /hε , the total collision rate is:
Cmin = f · k Dtarget −Dobs =

Hdyn Dtarget −Dobs
·k
hε

(9)

This completes the proof. □
Thermodynamic Corollary. Each collision event dissipates at minimum the Landauer cost kB T ln 2 (assuming binary resolution; factor ln k for k-ary). The minimum power

13

dissipation for algorithmic tracking with dimensional mismatch is:

Pmin = kB T ln 2 · Cmin = kB T ln 2 ·

Hdyn Dtarget −Dobs
·k
hε

(10)

For Dtarget − Dobs = 10 and k = 2, this yields 210 = 1024× power penalty. For Dtarget −
Dobs = 20, the penalty is 220 ≈ 106 ×. Algorithmic intelligence attempting to track highdimensional reality from a low-dimensional substrate faces exponential thermodynamic cost.
Explicit piecewise form. The tracking bound separates into two regimes:

 Dimensional matching (D

obs

≥ Dtarget ): Cmin ≳ Hdyn /hε . Every bit of target

dynamics must be processed at least once; collision rate scales polynomially in Dtarget .

 Dimensional mismatch (D < D
obs

target ): Cmin ≳ (Hdyn /hε ) · k

Dtarget −Dobs

. Exponen-

tial penalty from enumerating hypotheses over unobserved dimensions.
The compact form Cmin ≥ (Hdyn /hε ) · k max(0,Dtarget −Dobs ) captures both cases.
Connection to Ashby’s Law of Requisite Variety. This result can be understood
as a thermodynamic refinement of Ashby’s law of requisite variety [3]: a controller must have
at least as much variety as the disturbances it compensates. Here, “variety” is instantiated
as effective dimensionality Deff , and we show that when Dobs < Dtarget , the shortfall manifests as exponential collision cost (k Dtarget −Dobs ) rather than simply a loss in control quality.
Ashby’s principle provides the qualitative constraint; Theorem 1 quantifies its thermodynamic penalty via Landauer-limited power dissipation.
Implication: Intelligence Must Be High-Dimensional. The thermodynamic argument applies to all living systems, not just humans. Intelligence—the capacity to track
and respond to environmental complexity—is a fundamental property of life. A bacterium
tracking chemical gradients [44] navigates Dtarget ∼ 102 –103 (multiple ligand concentrations, spatial gradients, temporal dynamics) while dissipating ∼ 10−12 W. The human brain
tracks other agents, ecosystems, and internal physiology (Dtarget ∼ 103 –106 ) at ∼20 W. In
both cases, Dobs ≫ Dtarget is required: dimensional matching scales with the organism’s
14

behavioral bandwidth Cobs , not absolute power. A bacterium with Cobs ∼ 1 bit/s needs
Dcrit ∼ 0.01–0.1; cortex with Cobs ∼ 102 bits/s needs Dcrit ∼ 5. Both operate well above
their respective thresholds via high-dimensional substrates (bacterial chemotaxis networks,
neural oscillations). The only thermodynamically viable solution is Dobs ≫ Dtarget : intelligence must be implemented in high-dimensional substrates operating through collision-free
constraint geometry. This is not a design choice but a thermodynamic necessity for all living
systems.
Corollary (Simulation Impossibility). For any system with Dtarget ≫ 1, there exists
no bitwise simulator with Dobs < Dtarget that can faithfully track its dynamics at comparable
power dissipation. Either fidelity or efficiency must be sacrificed.
Why ”just add more bits” doesn’t work. Any finite physical system is, in a mathematical sense, encodable as a finite binary string. What this truism hides is the only part
that matters for physics: how many bits, updated how often, at what energy cost. Highdimensional biological systems such as brains generate new dynamical structure at a rate
Hdyn that rivals or exceeds the Landauer-limited commit capacity Cobs of any realistic digital
substrate at comparable power. In this timing-inaccessible regime there is no bitwise simulation that is at once faithful, real-time, and thermodynamically efficient. A digital model
must either coarse-grain away much of the underlying dynamics or pay a strictly higher
energetic cost than the system it attempts to track. The question is not whether you can
represent it in bits, but whether you can update those bits fast enough, at low enough power,
to track a high-dimensional system in real-time. The Dimensional Tracking Bound proves
the answer is no for Dobs < Dtarget .
Compressible vs. irreducible environments. In environments with reducible complexity—where sufficient statistics of dimension < Dtarget exist (e.g., natural images lying on
low-dimensional manifolds)—the bound applies to the effective target dimensionality of
those statistics, not the full microstate dimensionality. Biological systems exploit such structure when it exists. However, many tracking tasks involve irreducible complexity: ecosystems

15

with coupled nonlinear dynamics, multi-agent coordination, internal physiological regulation
with ∼ 106 molecular species, turbulent fluid flows (where prediction requires measuring essentially all degrees of freedom). For these, no faithful low-dimensional compression exists,
and Theorem 1’s exponential penalty applies in full.

1.8

Code Formation from Dimensional Mismatch

Theorem 1 immediately implies a second result: when two high-dimensional systems interact
through a low-dimensional communication channel, stable codes must form at the boundary
as a thermodynamic consequence of the exponential collision cost of dimensional mismatch.
Theorem 2 (Code Formation from Dimensional Mismatch). Consider two systems A and B with internal dimensionalities DA , DB ≫ 1 that interact through a communication channel of dimensionality Dlink < min(DA , DB ). If the systems successfully maintain
mutual coordination (each tracks relevant aspects of the other’s state) at power dissipation
Pobs , then stable reusable codes must form at the interface.
Proof. System A must track aspects of system B’s state through the low-dimensional
link. By Theorem 1, if A attempts to track the full DB -dimensional state through a Dlink dimensional observation channel, the collision cost is:
B
Hdyn
· k DB −Dlink
Craw ≥
hε

(11)

This exponential cost is prohibitive for DB −Dlink ≫ 1. However, suppose B’s state space
contains structured regions—subspaces Si that recur frequently and are behaviorally relevant
to A. If A can represent these regions as discrete codes ci (low-dimensional symbols), the
effective dimensionality of what must be tracked collapses from DB to Dcode ∼ logk (Ncodes ),
where Ncodes is the size of the codebook.

16

With codes, the collision cost becomes:

Ccoded ≥

B
Hdyn
· k Dcode −Dlink + Cencode
hε

(12)

where Cencode is the cost of mapping B’s high-dimensional state onto the discrete code ci (a
one-time compression cost per code).
Thermodynamic favorability. For sufficiently large dimensional mismatch, we have:

k Dcode −Dlink ≪ k DB −Dlink

(13)

Thus Ccoded ≪ Craw . Code formation is thermodynamically favorable: systems that fail
to form stable codes pay exponentially higher collision costs and are outcompeted or fail to
maintain coordination.
Code stability emerges from reuse. A code ci becomes stable when:
1. Recurrence: The subspace Si occurs frequently in B’s dynamics
2. Compressibility: Si can be reliably identified from low-dimensional projections (otherwise encoding cost Cencode dominates)
3. Behavioral relevance: Tracking Si enables A to coordinate effectively with B (otherwise the code provides no fitness benefit)
When these conditions hold, the code ci is reinforced through repeated use, as each
successful encoding amortizes Cencode over many tracking events. Unstable or rarely-used
codes are pruned because their encoding cost exceeds the collision savings.
Implication: The origin of symbolic communication. This theorem provides a
thermodynamic explanation for the emergence of language, gesture, and other symbolic codes
in biological and social systems. When two agents with high internal dimensionality (Dbrain ∼
103 –106 ) coordinate through low-bandwidth channels (speech ∼ 50 phonemes/s, gesture ∼ 10
distinct poses), stable symbolic codes are not merely useful —they are thermodynamically
17

necessary. Systems that fail to compress high-dimensional intentions into low-dimensional
symbols cannot maintain coordination without prohibitive collision costs.
Similarly, the formation of concepts, categories, and mental models can be understood
as internal code formation: the brain’s low-dimensional output systems (motor cortex ∼
102 active neurons) must coordinate with high-dimensional sensory and cognitive dynamics
(∼ 106 cortical neurons), forcing the emergence of reusable symbolic representations that
compress high-dimensional percepts into manipulable codes.
Connection to Bayesian compression. The formation of codes is equivalent to constructing a structured prior over B’s state space. Instead of treating all k DB hypotheses
as equally likely (maximum entropy prior), the codebook imposes structure: ”system B is
likely in one of Ncodes recurring configurations Si .” This structured prior reduces the effective hypothesis space from k DB to Ncodes · k Dresidual , where Dresidual ≪ DB captures withincode variation. The exponential savings arise from exploiting statistical regularity in B’s
dynamics—precisely the mechanism by which Bayesian compression escapes the curse of
dimensionality in practice [29].
Numerical illustration. We demonstrate this spontaneous code formation numerically
in Section 3 (Figure 1, Panel D). A 50-pathway adaptive network exposed to clustered
task structure spontaneously concentrates weight onto ∼10% of pathways, with clear code
clustering emerging from Hebbian-like dynamics. This validates Theorem 2’s prediction
that dimensional mismatch drives code formation (see code formation simulation.py in
supplementary materials).
Code drift and co-evolution. Because both A and B face symmetric dimensional
mismatch (each tracks the other through Dlink ), codes must be mutually stabilized. If A uses
code ci to represent a subspace of B, then B must use a corresponding code c′i to represent the
subspace of A that triggers ci . This mutual stabilization creates co-evolutionary pressure:
codes that are not mutually interpretable fail to reduce collision costs and are pruned. Over
time, this drives convergence toward shared symbolic representations—the thermodynamic

18

origin of communication protocols, social conventions, and cultural norms.
Why biological intelligence escapes the Bayesian explosion. Biological systems
do not enumerate hypotheses over discrete state spaces. Instead:

 Continuous constraint geometry: ”Hypotheses” exist as attractors in high-dimensional
phase space, not as discrete states requiring resolution

 Parallel exploration: Incompatible interpretations coexist via superposition in orthogonal subspaces—multiple candidate solutions evolve simultaneously without forced
collision

 Gradient-based convergence: Constraint satisfaction through energy minimization
(relaxation to attractor) rather than explicit hypothesis enumeration

 Sparse collapse: Behavioral output collapses wavefunction to discrete action, but
internal deliberation remains collision-free
The Bayesian-geometric duality. Discrete Bayesian inference (k n hypotheses) and
continuous high-dimensional exploration (n-dimensional phase space) solve the same computational problems but with radically different thermodynamic costs:
Bayesian (discrete): Collision count ∼ O(k n )
(14)
Geometric (continuous): Collision count = 0 until measurement
The exponential k n collision requirement becomes a polynomial convergence time governed by energy landscape geometry. This is why VAS-like problems remain tractable in

§

biological systems despite being Ackermann-complete for discrete enumeration (see 3).
Implication for artificial intelligence. Current AI systems (neural networks trained
via SGD, Bayesian optimizers, probabilistic graphical models) operate through discrete
weight updates and gradient computations. Each training iteration requires:

 Forward pass: O(layers × weights) multiply-accumulate collisions
19

 Backward pass: O(layers × weights) gradient collisions
 Weight update: O(weights) write collisions
Training GPT-scale models (∼ 1011 parameters, ∼ 1013 tokens) requires ∼ 1024 collision
events [20], consuming megawatts continuously. Biological intelligence achieves comparable
representational complexity while dissipating ∼ 20 W—six orders of magnitude less—because
it operates collision-free until behavioral output.
The clocking constraint: Digital systems enforce temporal synchronization via a
global clock signal. Every register must settle to a definite state at each clock edge, forcing Deff /Dcrit → 1 regardless of architectural complexity. Biological systems operate unclocked—oscillations emerge from coupled dynamics without external synchronization. This
permits Deff ≫ Dcrit to persist between measurement events, as there is no mechanism forcing
dimensional collapse every cycle.
substrate
(biology, quantum sysThermodynamic consequence: Systems with high Deff

than observation capacity can track, colliding only at measurement bottlenecks. Systems

substrate
with low Deff

The two–three orders of magnitude power gap reflects the thermodynamic cost of collision
resolution. Clocked architectures resolve collisions at GHz rates; biological systems operate
collision-free and unclocked, collapsing only at behavioral bottleneck (∼ 100 bits/s).

The Observable Dimensionality Bound: Foundations

2.1

Information Content vs Energy Budget

Consider a turbulent vortex. The fluid contains intricate structure: velocity gradients, pressure fields, eddies at multiple scales. How much information does it contain?
The answer depends on your measurement budget. If you sample the velocity
field at millimeter resolution, you extract modest information. At micron resolution, vastly
more. At nanometer resolution, the information content would exceed what you could store
as classical bits given the vortex’s energy.
The fundamental constraint: To extract information from a physical system requires
paying the Landauer cost: kB T ln 2 per bit. A system with energy E can yield at most
E/(kB T ln 2) measurable bits. But the dynamical structure—the evolving geometry of the
flow—exists at arbitrarily fine resolution. The information is there, but inaccessible below
your measurement threshold.
This is the key to biological computation: dynamics can carry more information
than you could represent bit-wise with the available energy budget. A turbulent
flow, coupled oscillators, neural populations—all exploit the same principle. The dynamics
21

evolve through time-varying geometric structure without colliding. Information lives in constraint geometry until measurement forces dimensional collapse, paying Landauer cost only
for bits actually extracted.

2.2

Constraint Geometry and Information Emergence

Constraint geometry refers to high-dimensional dynamical structure evolving with zero
entropy production (hprod
= 0). Between measurement events, the system maintains precise
ε
geometric relationships (phase correlations, velocity fields, concentration gradients) coupled
through physical constraints. No classical bits are created; information exists as structure
in the geometry itself.
The paradigmatic example: Kuramoto oscillators with N coupled phases ϕi :

ϕ̇i = ωi +

X

Kij sin(ϕj − ϕi )

(15)

j

Phase coherence is quantified by the complex order parameter:
N

reiψ =

1 X iϕj
e
N j=1

(16)

where r ∈ [0, 1] measures global synchronization.
The key mechanism: Oscillators coupled through Kij create a time-varying topology—the pattern of phase relationships {ϕi − ϕj } defines a geometric structure that reconfigures continuously. When many oscillators are coupled, this topology becomes highdimensional and evolves faster than measurement can track.
Effective dimensionality Deff quantifies active degrees of freedom, typically estimated via
participation ratio:
Deff =

(Tr[C])2
Tr[C 2 ]

where C is the covariance matrix of oscillator states.
22

(17)

Timing information lives in phase relationships. The dimensionality is encoded in
correlations like ⟨cos(ϕi − ϕj )⟩ evolving at different rates. This time-varying topology carries
the computation—constraint satisfaction happens through geometric reconfiguration, not
discrete state updates. To extract this temporal structure, measurement must resolve when
phase adjustments occur—but this requires channel capacity exceeding what’s available at
behavioral output.

2.3

Measurement Capacity and the Critical Threshold

Observation occurs through a channel with finite capacity Cobs (bits/s) [5], bounded by
behavioral output constraints—reaction times, choice entropy, motor bandwidth—not by
the intrinsic dynamics rate Hdyn .
For biological behavioral outputs: motor commands, speech, choices. Typical values
Cobs ∼ 102 bits/s.
The critical dimension Dcrit represents the maximum dimensionality observable with
capacity Cobs :
Dcrit =

Cobs τe
αhtrack
ε

(18)

Physical interpretation: If you have Cobs bits/s available and the system generates
αhtrack
Deff /τe bits/s through constraint evolution, you can track up to Dcrit modes. Beyond
ε
that threshold, the geometry reconfigures faster than measurement can follow.

2.4

Timing Inaccessibility: The Operational Consequence

When Deff > Dcrit :

 You can detect that high-dimensional structure exists (through integrated observables:
total energy, global coherence)

 You cannot resolve the temporal trajectory ϕ (t ), ϕ (t ), . . .
i

23

0

i

1

 You cannot determine which configurations were visited in what order
 The timing information required for discrete decomposition is physically inaccessible
This is not technological limitation but thermodynamic fact. Extracting timing information requires injecting measurement energy ≥ kB T ln 2 per bit, which would destroy the
coherence enabling the computation. This establishes a projection bound: continuous substrates can support dynamics richer than any discrete measurement can capture [2], creating
regimes where falsifiability itself becomes limited by measurement thresholds [1].

2.5

Worked Example: Human Cortex

Neural oscillations as computation substrate. Miller and colleagues demonstrate that
cortical computation emerges from coupled neural oscillations, not discrete symbolic operations. Working memory, for instance, operates through sustained oscillatory patterns in
prefrontal cortex—information exists as geometric structure in phase relationships, not as
stored bits. The system maintains coherence over seconds, collapsing to discrete behavioral
outputs only when decisions are made.
We can estimate the accessible regime from magnetoencephalography (MEG) observables.
MEG source reconstruction typically yields hundreds of cortical parcels (order-of-magnitude
N ∼ 102 –103 , often 200–400 depending on parcellation) coupling across quasi-independent
frequency bands (alpha, beta, gamma: |B| ∼ 3–5) [15]. If task-relevant dynamics involve
coordinated activity across these parcels and bands with task-selective sparsity κ ∈ [0.2, 0.4]
[16], a conservative estimate of effective dimensionality is:

MEG
Deff
∼ κN |B| ≈ 0.3 × 250 × 4 ≈ 300

(19)

Here κ ∼ 0.3 heuristically accounts for spatial correlations between sensors and taskMEG
selective engagement; any choice in the range 0.1–0.5 leaves the core result Deff
≫ Dcrit

unchanged. This is explicitly a conservative lower bound based on MEG resolution.
24

This is a lower bound—what MEG can resolve. The true substrate dimensionality is
difficult to pin down precisely: at finer spatial scales (local field potential (LFP), spiking) and
faster timescales, Deff plausibly reaches 103 –104 through within-parcel microcircuits, though
the ”functional” dimensionality depends on measurement constraints and timescales.
Behavioral output: reaction time + choice entropy yields Cobs ∈ [10, 100] bits/s. With
τe ≈ 100 ms (alpha cycle), htrack
≈ 2 bits/mode, α ≈ 0.9, we can now compute Dcrit explicitly
ε
using the formula Dcrit = Cobs τe /(αhtrack
):
ε
Concrete numerical example: For mid-range parameters (Cobs ∼ 102 bits/s, τe ∼ 0.1
∼ 2 bits/mode, α ∼ 1):

Therefore:

Even at MEG-accessible scales, cortex operates ∼ 102 × above the observability threshold.

MEG

parcels (LFP/spiking), avoiding conflation of measurement bandwidth with intrinsic degrees

What matters for our argument is that any computational subsystem tracking a high-D
target must itself be high-D. A sensorimotor pathway tracking a Dtarget ∼ 103 environment
requires Dobs ≳ 103 substrate. The brain achieves this via massively parallel high-D neural
populations, not by exhaustively tracking every molecular degree of freedom. The hierarchy

The coastline paradox of dimensionality. Even these estimates undercount ontological dimensionality. Physical systems are continuous—the more finely you measure, the
more dimensions emerge (analogous to the coastline paradox: measured length increases
with ruler precision). A single synapse involves ∼ 106 molecular species across vesicle trafficking, receptor dynamics, actin remodeling, local protein synthesis. Zooming to quantum
scales reveals effectively infinite degrees of freedom. Our Deff estimates are measurementscale-dependent vortices: the relevant dimensionality for a given computational task. A
sensorimotor pathway ”sees” D ∼ 103 because that’s the scale at which constraint geometry
couples to behavior. Molecular details are thermally averaged noise at this scale. This is
why the framework works: systems exploit dimensional hierarchy, computing at the coarsegrained scale where relevant constraints live, not exhaustively tracking fine-grained chaos.
It’s vortices all the way down—each scale exhibits its own effective dimensionality relative
to the observational resolution.

unmeasurable at behavioral output—we can only observe integrated results.
26

Important qualification: This MEG-level estimate vastly underestimates total substrate complexity. A single neuron contains enormous molecular/biochemical dynamics (ion
channels, vesicle trafficking, gene regulation, protein synthesis). The ∼1011 neurons, ∼1015
synapses, and continuous metabolic/electrical activity represent information flow orders of
magnitude beyond what any coarse-grained ”bits/s” measure can capture. Our framework
addresses only the macroscopic constraint geometry accessible to systems-level measurement
(MEG, behavior). The true Hdyn at cellular/molecular scales is effectively unmeasurable and
likely irrelevant to behavioral computation—what matters is the dimensionality of constraint
relationships that couple to action, not the exhaustive microscopic state. This is precisely
why timing-inaccessible computation works: massive substrate complexity supports sparse,
low-dimensional behavioral outputs without requiring bit-wise tracking of the substrate itself.

Vector Addition Systems: Tractability Through HighDimensional Exploration

3.1

The Computational Paradox

Vector addition systems (VAS) formalize constrained state-space navigation. States are
integer vectors v ∈ Nn ; transitions add or subtract fixed vectors. The reachability problem—
can we reach target vtarget from initial vinit ?—has been proven Ackermann-complete [10, 11],
with complexity beyond any elementary function of input size.
Example (2D VAS): States (x, y) ∈ N2 , transitions {(+1, −1), (−2, +1), (+3, 0)}. Is
(5, 3) reachable from (0, 0)? Discrete algorithms must enumerate all possible sequences. For
n-dimensional systems with m transitions, the search space grows as Ackermann function
A(n, m)—computationally intractable.
Yet biological systems routinely solve VAS-like problems:

27

 Motor planning: Reaching for an object requires coordinating ∼ 30 muscles under
biomechanical constraints (joint limits, torque bounds, obstacle avoidance). This is
high-dimensional VAS with continuous state updates.

 Metabolic optimization: Cells select among exponentially many biochemical pathways to achieve metabolic targets given resource constraints.

 Navigation: Animals traverse complex environments, satisfying multiple constraints
(energy budget, predator avoidance, foraging efficiency) simultaneously.

 Decision-making: Humans evaluate options across incommensurable dimensions (cost,
benefit, risk, social impact) to reach goals.
The paradox: If VAS reachability is computationally intractable, why do biological
systems solve such problems efficiently?

3.2

High-Dimensional Exploration in Constraint Geometry

Simulation note: The numerical implementations provided (Python scripts in supplementary materials) are illustrative models, not literal physical substrates. The continuous VAS
solver, for example, uses discrete-time gradient descent to approximate what collision-free
dynamics in a high-dimensional continuous substrate would achieve. Although our continuous dynamics are implemented on a digital machine, those collisions occur in the simulating
substrate. The thermodynamic argument is about the simulated high-dimensional dynamics: in a physical implementation of the continuous field (e.g., coupled oscillators, neural
populations, analog circuits), those intermediate state updates would not require separate
bit-erasure events. The point is to demonstrate the qualitative difference between collisionheavy discrete enumeration and collision-free continuous exploration.
Consider a continuous analog: coupled oscillators where phase naturally performs vector

Why Timing Inaccessibility Enables Solution

Critical insight: This high-dimensional exploration succeeds precisely because it operates
in timing-inaccessible regimes.
Discrete VAS algorithms must track:

 Which transition was applied at each step
 The temporal order of state changes
 The specific path through state space
This requires Hreg ∼ (transitions per second)—high collision rate paying Landauer cost
continuously.
High-dimensional exploration:

 Explores constraint manifold in high-dimensional space (D ≫ D )
eff

29

crit

 No discrete transitions—system evolves smoothly with h = 0
 Timing information about path through solution space is inaccessible
 Only final coherent state (solution) is measured, paying Landauer cost once
prod
ε

VAS becomes tractable because the temporal decomposition required for discrete enumeration is physically prohibited. We cannot determine when individual phase adjustments
happened; we can only detect that constraint satisfaction occurred through integrated coherence.
Escaping local minima: Real-world VAS-type problems are collision-prone—discrete
states force sequential resolution that can get stuck at local optima. High-dimensional
collision-free computation enables a representational shift: incompatible states can coexist temporarily through superposition, allowing the system to bypass local traps that stall
discrete searches. Mental models need not include obstacles during exploration—constraint
satisfaction happens through continuous gradient dynamics in the joint geometry, not sequential collision resolution. Biological systems appear to exploit exactly this—escaping
local minima in motor planning, navigation, and problem-solving by operating in collisionfree regimes during deliberation, collapsing to discrete actions only at behavioral collision.

3.4

Numerical Illustration

Simple 2D VAS: Goal (5, 5) from (0, 0) with constrained transitions (e.g., T1 = (0, +2),
T2 = (0, −1), T3 = (+1, 0), T4 = (+1, −1)—randomly generated set ensuring nontrivial path
complexity).
Discrete approach: Enumerate sequences checking validity and non-negativity constraints. With constrained transitions, reaching target requires exploring multiple paths
with backtracking. Worst-case searches exponential in target coordinates.

30

Continuous approach: Map to oscillators:
ϕx = phase encoding x-coordinate
(26)
ϕy = phase encoding y-coordinate
Couplings enforce VAS transitions, target state encodes (5, 5) as stable attractor. Energy:

E = −[cos(ϕx − 5∆) + cos(ϕy − 5∆)]

(27)

System relaxes to minimum where ϕx ≈ 5∆, ϕy ≈ 5∆ (solution found).
Concrete dynamics: Starting from random initial phases, overdamped Langevin evolution:
τ ϕ̇i = −

∂E p
+ 2τ kB T ξi (t)
∂ϕi

(28)

with friction time τ ∼ 10 ms, thermal noise T ∼ 300 K. Typical relaxation time τrelax ∼
100 ms to 1 s, independent of path complexity. Computational cost: O(τrelax /∆t) ∼ 104
integration steps for ∆t ∼ 0.1 ms.
Clarification on ”collision-free”: The substrate operates approximately reversibly
between collisions; thermal noise (ξi (t)) is present but maintenance power counters it to
keep net entropy production hprod
≈ 0 during exploration. Collisions (measurement-induced
ε
collapse) are the dominant source of irreversible entropy.
Empirical scaling: For n-dimensional VAS, high-dimensional exploration replaces combinatorial path enumeration with convergence governed by the energy landscape’s spectral
gap and mixing time. Computational cost scales with relaxation dynamics (O(nτrelax /∆t)),
not with path-space size. While this doesn’t change worst-case complexity classes (VAS
reachability remains Ackermann-complete in the discrete formulation), it explains why biological systems solve VAS-like problems efficiently: continuous exploration avoids the combinatorial explosion that makes discrete enumeration intractable. Real examples (motor
planning with n ∼ 30 muscles) remain practically tractable through high-dimensional explo31

ration.

3.5

Simulation: Collision vs Collision-Free Dynamics

To demonstrate the mechanism explicitly, we simulated the 2D VAS above using both discrete
transitions (collision-based) and high-dimensional exploration (collision-free).
Discrete VAS implementation: States (x, y) ∈ N2 , transitions applied sequentially
with coupling (each move affects multiple coordinates). Each state change represents a
collision event—mutually exclusive states cannot coexist, forcing discrete resolution. Greedy
heuristic selects transition minimizing distance to target. Result: 4 discrete transitions
(4 collision events) required to successfully reach target (5, 5) from origin. Clarification:
“4 collisions” means the algorithm took 4 sequential state-transition steps to find a valid
path. Each step requires evaluating available transitions and picking one (discrete choice =
collision). The algorithm converged successfully for this 2D case.
High-dimensional implementation: 200 coupled oscillators with phases ϕxi , ϕyi encoding coordinates.

Target state (5, 5) encoded as attractor phases.

Dynamics follow

overdamped Langevin equation (Eq. above). Phases interfere through coupling but never
collide—incompatible configurations coexist in orthogonal subspaces. Result: smooth convergence in O(102 − 103 ) integration steps with zero collision events (given the dt and
parameters used). Note: This 2D example uses separable coordinates for pedagogical clarity; the formal cross-dimensional coupling via constraint vectors wk appears in the general
P
energy E(ϕ) = − k gk cos(⟨wk , ϕ⟩ − φk ) described above.
Key observation: The discrete system required 4 collision resolutions (2D case), each
paying Landauer cost kB T ln 2. The continuous system evolved collision-free through highdimensional phase space, paying Landauer cost only once at final measurement. Power
dissipation P ∝ collision rate, not dimensionality.
The discrete trajectory exhibits sharp angular transitions—each corner is a collision
event forcing discrete state resolution.

The continuous trajectory shows smooth expo32

nential convergence through phase interference without forced state collapses (Figure 1,
panels A–B). This directly demonstrates the central thesis: collision-free computation
through high-dimensional constraint geometry enables tractable solution of problems intractable via discrete enumeration. The power advantage follows immediately—collision rate determines dissipation, and high-D systems operate collision-free until
dimensional collapse at measurement.
Dimensional scaling: To assess whether the collision-free advantage persists at biologically realistic dimensions, we extended the simulation to VAS with n ∈ {2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 100},
spanning toy models through motor planning (n ∼ 30 muscles) to complex decision-making
(n ∼ 100 factors). We use independent transitions—each action affects a single dimension—representing the best case for discrete search (no coupling, guaranteed convergence).
We tested 20 random problem instances per dimension (varied start/target positions). Results (Table 2) demonstrate clean thermodynamic scaling: discrete search always succeeds
but requires collision counts scaling approximately as 4n (mean values: 8, 19, 39, 80, 116,
199, 397 for n = 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 100). Each collision pays Landauer cost kB T ln 2. In
contrast, continuous high-dimensional exploration converges collision-free at all dimensions
(n = 2–100), paying thermodynamic cost only at the final measurement. Figure 1C shows
linear scaling: discrete collision count increases with dimension, while continuous remains
identically zero throughout.
The collision-free advantage increases linearly with dimensionality: at n = 100 (realistic
for complex decision-making), discrete requires ∼397× more thermodynamic cost than continuous, despite both approaches successfully converging. This is purely a thermodynamic
advantage—the continuous approach pays Landauer cost once at measurement, while discrete pays at every state transition. Higher-D spaces provide more orthogonal subspaces
for collision-free exploration. This explains why motor planning with ∼30 muscles (requiring ∼120 discrete collisions vs. 0 continuous collisions) remains power-efficient in biological
systems operating through high-dimensional constraint geometry.

Table 2: VAS Performance Scaling with Dimensionality (Empirical Results from
Independent-Transition VAS). Independent transitions represent the best case for discrete
search—no coupling conflicts, guaranteed convergence. Values show mean ± std across 20
random problem instances (varied start/target positions). Even in this optimal scenario,
discrete requires O(n) collision events, each paying Landauer cost kB T ln 2. Continuous
high-D exploration succeeds collision-free at all scales, paying thermodynamic cost only at
measurement. This demonstrates the fundamental thermodynamic advantage of collisionfree computation, independent of algorithmic complexity. All results reproducible from ESM
code.

Scaling: Discrete ≈ 3.95n + 0.6 (linear fit R2 = 0.9996), Continuous ≡ 0 (both always converge)

Complexity-theoretic precision: We do not alter worst-case complexity classifications. VAS reachability remains Ackermann-complete in the discrete formulation. Our claim
is that practical instances become tractable when represented as high-dimensional continuous relaxations whose convergence is governed by spectral gaps and mixing times rather
than path-space enumeration. Formally, for VAS with transitions {tk }, there exists a phaseP
coupled network with energy E(ϕ) = − k gk cos(⟨wk , ϕ⟩−φk ) such that minima correspond
to feasible states satisfying constraints induced by {tk }. Under mild regularity (positive definite Hessian at minima), overdamped Langevin dynamics converge to an ε-optimal minimum
in time set by the spectral gap of the linearized flow—avoiding the combinatorial explosion
that makes discrete enumeration intractable.
Failure modes and conditions: Continuous relaxations can stall on rough landscapes
(poor spectral gaps) or under strong frustration. In practice, biological systems exploit noiseassisted escape (stochastic resonance), adaptive couplings, and multi-scale schedules (crossfrequency coupling) that widen basins and improve gaps. Our claim is conditional: when
effective dynamics retain sufficient coherence to maintain large Deff /Dcrit and the induced
34

energy landscape has moderate condition number, convergence times scale with relaxation
parameters rather than path-space size.

3.5.1

Biological Scale: Blind Tactile Manipulation

Complex sensorimotor tasks demonstrate collision-free advantage at realistic dimensions.
Consider blind tactile manipulation (e.g., tying a drawstring while jogging): Deff ≈ 25, 000
(24,000 mechanoreceptors + proprioception + motor control).
Discrete intractability: At n = 25, 000, our scaling predicts ∼100,000 collisions
per VAS solution. Real-time control (1 kHz) over 8 seconds requires ∼8×108 collision
events—computationally infeasible for discrete optimization.
Biological solution: Sensorimotor cortex implements continuous attractor dynamics.
Population firing rates evolve collision-free through constraint geometry (M1-S1-PPC loops)
until task completion triggers single dimensional collapse (basal ganglia Go/No-Go). Brain
power remains ∼20 W regardless of task dimensionality—the signature of collision-free operation where power tracks system maintenance, not computational complexity.
This example demonstrates why seemingly trivial human sensorimotor tasks remain
robot-impossible: effective dimensionality (Deff ∼ 104 ) vastly exceeds regime where discrete
sampling/optimization is feasible (n ≲ 100). Collision-free continuous dynamics become
not merely advantageous but mechanistically necessary—the only known way to perform
real-time constraint satisfaction in 25,000-dimensional spaces.
Code availability: Full simulation code (Python) including n-dimensional VAS extension and dimensional analysis calculations is provided in Supplementary Material. The implementation can be adapted for higher-dimensional problems or alternative coupling schemes.

3.6

Code Formation Through Adaptive Dynamics

Beyond tractability, high-dimensional collision-free exploration enables structural discovery:
the spontaneous emergence of reusable solution patterns. When constraint satisfaction tasks
35

share similar structure, adaptive systems discover modular pathway combinations that get
repeatedly invoked—forming “codes” through Hebbian-like strengthening of successful connections.
We tested this in a simplified 50-pathway adaptive network solving 100 constraint satisfaction tasks clustered around 5 similar patterns (code in ESM). Over 100 trials:

 Pathway specialization: Weight concentration increased from 1.8× (early trials) to
3.6× (final trials), a 99% increase. Initially, pathways contribute equally; by trial 100,
specific pathways dominate.

 Modular structure: The top 5 pathways (10% of total) carried 34.5% of solution
weight by trial 100, indicating strong modularity.

 Performance advantage: Adaptive system achieved 22% success rate vs 4% for
discrete enumeration (5.5× better).

 Code reuse: Projecting solutions from 50D pathway space to 2D via PCA reveals
clustering—successful solutions occupy stable regions of pathway space, reused across
similar tasks. Discrete enumeration shows uniform scatter (no learning, Figure 1D).
This shows that collision-free dynamics coupled with adaptive weights spontaneously discover reusable constraint patterns unavailable to discrete enumeration. The system learns
which high-dimensional subspaces solve which classes of problems, forming a library of codes.
This mechanism may underlie the emergence of modular network structure through Hebbian
plasticity observed in both biological and artificial neural networks [41]. The resulting pathway structure—heavy-tailed degree distributions with filament-like organization—exhibits
quantitative similarities to cosmic web structure formation [40], suggesting dimensional collapse leaves characteristic “shadows” in physical network topology.

solved via continuous gradient descent: converges successfully in 36 steps with zero collision
events (thermodynamic cost paid only at final measurement = 1 kB T ln 2). The key distinction is collision count, not solvability—even when discrete easily succeeds (independent
transitions, no coupling), it accumulates O(n) irreversible transitions; continuous pays only
once. (C) Dimensional scaling with independent transitions (best case for discrete): perfect
O(n) collision scaling (exponent = 1.00) with 10, 25, 50, 100, 150, 250, 500 collisions, while
continuous remains collision-free (≡ 0) at all dimensions including biologically realistic scales
(n = 30–100). Both approaches always converge. (D) Code formation in 50-dimensional

3.7

Information Density Tradeoff

Beyond collision reduction, high-dimensional exploration exhibits a fundamental information compression property analogous to the dimensional collapse observed in autocatalytic
chemistry. We quantify this via information density η:

η=

Itask
Deff

(29)

where Itask measures task-solving fidelity (bits of constraint satisfaction) and Deff measures
effective dimensionality of active pathways.
Key finding: Learning-driven pathway formation increases η by compressing taskrelevant information into lower-dimensional codes. In simulations with adaptive coupling
(Figure 1D), we observe:

 Early phase (random couplings): D ≈ 35–45, I
eff

task ≈ 8–12 bits ⇒ η ≈ 0.22–0.34

bits/dimension

 Late phase (learned codes): D

eff

≈ 12–18, Itask ≈ 18–24 bits ⇒ η ≈ 1.2–1.8

bits/dimension

 Compression factor: η increases by ∼4–6× (400–600%), demonstrating that learning
converts dimensional complexity into informational compression
This parallels autocatalytic chemistry where dimensional collapse concentrates chemical
flux onto reusable reaction pathways with η gains of +55% to +158%. The mechanism is
universal: amplification-driven code formation (Hebbian learning in neural systems, autocatalysis in chemistry) compresses high-dimensional exploration onto low-dimensional stable
structures that encode task solutions efficiently.
Biological significance: Motor cortex exhibits precisely this property—skilled movements show concentrated activation patterns (low Deff ) achieving complex goals (high Itask )

38

with high η, whereas unskilled movements show diffuse activation (high Deff ) with poor performance (low Itask , low η). The information density framework predicts that expertise =
dimensional compression.

Robustness and Perturbation Analysis

Perturbation tolerance: (i) ±20% coupling noise
oscillator deactivation

 85–92% task success; (ii) 10–15%

 70–80% eventual success via redundancy; (iii) ±15% target shift

 graceful degradation (2–3× slower).

Noise-assisted escape: Thermal noise enables local minima escape, improving convergence 15–25% [49]. Compositional recombination: 65–75% success on novel hybrid
problems via modular code reuse.
These properties arise from high-D continuous dynamics: perturbations preserve basin
structure, noise enables diffusion, modularity emerges from code clustering. Discrete systems
lack this—requiring complete re-enumeration under perturbation.

3.9

Simulation Limitations and Assumptions

Key limitations: (i) Sinusoidal couplings approximate real STDP/dendritic nonlinearities;
(ii) Hebbian learning abstracts synaptic consolidation/homeostasis; (iii) continuous approximation valid when spike rates ν ≫ decision rates fdecision ; (iv) independent-transition VAS
represents optimal case for discrete (real problems worse); (v) fixed integration windows vs.
adaptive biological timing; (vi) information-theoretic limits vs. full bioenergetics.
Testable predictions: (i) Does Deff scale with task dimensionality? (MEG/electrode
arrays); (ii) Do collapse events align with behaviors? (participation ratio time-locked to
decisions); (iii) Does η increase with expertise? (novice vs. expert comparison); (iv) Do
perturbations show robustness? (TMS/optogenetics).
These simulations provide existence proofs for collision-free mechanisms; neural validation
via high-density recordings is the critical next step.

Dimensional Expansion and Collapse: The Computation Cycle

We can characterize expansion only through integral observables. The geometric information scales with dimensionality:

Igeom (τenvelope ) ∝ log2 Deff (τenvelope )

(30)

The internal dynamics—which configurations visited when—remain inaccessible. VAS
solution happens during unmeasured evolution. Any attempt to observe the solution pathway
would inject measurement energy destroying coherence.

4.2

Collapse Phase: Dimensional Reduction to Measurement

Collapse occurs when coherence exceeds threshold r > rc or integration time reaches τenvelope .
High-dimensional state projects onto low-dimensional measurement:

40

Output = M[ϕ(τcollapse )]

(31)

where measurement operator M has dimensionality Dmeasure ≪ Deff .

Output =

The integrand depends on pointwise values ϕi (t), but those values are not jointly measurable with their timing. Collapse extracts the integral without accessing temporal decomposition.

Biological Implementation: Sparse Collisions

Cortical computation implements this cycle:
Expansion: Neural populations maintain coherent oscillations (theta/alpha/beta/gamma
bands nested hierarchically). Effective dimensionality Deff ∼ 104 explored through crossfrequency coupling. Duration ∼ 100 ms to seconds depending on task.

41

Collapse: Behavioral decision/motor command. Dimensional reduction from Deff ∼ 104
to Dmeasure ∼ 10 (bits written to action). Collapse frequency ∼ 1–10 Hz (behavioral rate).
Power efficiency: Collision rate Hreg ∼ 102 bits/s sets the Landauer floor:

PLandauer =

kB T ln 2
Hreg ∼ 3 × 10−19 W (irreducible collision cost)
η

(35)

Observed power P ≈ 20 W is dominated by metabolic maintenance (ionic pumps, vesicle
cycling, synaptic homeostasis), not information collisions. Digital systems forcing Hreg ∼
1010 bits/s (GHz clocking) dissipate orders of magnitude more at comparable dynamical
richness:
Pdigital ∼ 103 –104 W

(36)

The power gap arises from (1) sparse collisions versus continuous clocking, and (2) efficient
maintenance versus active cooling requirements.

Prediction 3: Collapse Signatures

Sudden dimensional reduction events should be detectable, correlated with behavioral outputs.
Operational definition: Collapse = abrupt drop in Deff by factor > 2 within <

hop), frequency bands: α (8–12 Hz), β (13–30 Hz), γ (30–70 Hz). Recipe: (1) sourcereconstruct MEG to 200–400 cortical parcels (e.g., beamformer/MNE with anatomical atlas), (2) bandpass-filter each parcel timeseries, (3) extract instantaneous phase via Hilbert
transform, (4) compute phase-locking value (PLVij = |⟨ei(ϕi −ϕj ) ⟩t |) between parcels for coherence measure r(t), (5) construct parcel×band covariance C from phase-amplitude coupling,

Prediction 4: Sub-Landauer Temporal Resolution

Neural populations should resolve temporal differences ∆t where the corresponding energy
difference ∆E = (dE/dt) · ∆t ≪ kB T ln 2, even though the total signal energy Esignal ≫
kB T ln 2. This is not sub-Landauer signal detection (which would violate thermodynamics),
but sub-Landauer temporal fine-graining: at any moment, the system has energy E(t); a
time slice ∆t later, it has E(t + ∆t). When ∆t is sufficiently small (temporal fine-graining
in continuous dynamics), ∆E ≪ kB T ln 2 even though both E(t) and E(t + ∆t) individually exceed the Landauer bound. Measurement occurs only at sparse collisions extracting
integrated information; the continuous dynamics between collisions achieve sub-Landauer
temporal resolution without requiring sub-Landauer measurement.
Test: Psychophysical detection thresholds for weak stimuli as function of integration
√
time τ . Predict threshold Ethresh ∝ 1/ τ (Weber-Fechner scaling), falling below Landauer
limit for τ > 100 ms.
Mechanism: Integration over τ accumulates signal without requiring measurement resolution at individual time points. Sub-Landauer temporal deltas become detectable through
coherent integration, with measurement (bit-writing) occurring only at the end of the integration window.

Thermodynamic Feasibility and Optimization

6.1

The Feasibility Bound

For timing-inaccessible computation to be thermodynamically viable, two conditions must
hold:
Condition 1: Coherence preservation. Entropy production from decoherence must
remain below collision rate to preserve coherence against environmental noise:

Σeff < Hreg

(39)

where Σeff (bits/s) denotes the effective entropy flux from noise-induced decoherence
(e.g., Σeff ∼ κ Deff /τcoherence for some bits-per-mode factor κ). If decoherence produces more
entropy than measurement collisions extract, the system cannot maintain timing-inaccessible
dynamics. Note: both Σeff and Hreg are in bits/s; multiplying by kB T ln 2 converts to power
(W).
Condition 2: Power budget. Total collision rate must stay within metabolic power:

Hreg ln 2 <

Pavailable
kB T

(40)

Each bit written dissipates ≥ kB T ln 2 (Landauer bound).
Maintenance vs collision power floors. To sustain coherence against noise that
would generate an entropy flux Σeff (bits/s), the minimal maintenance power is

Pmaint ≥ kB T ln 2 · Σeff

(41)

while logically irreversible collisions impose

Pcollision ≥ kB T ln 2 · Hreg

45

(42)

Hence total power requirement:

Ptotal ≥ kB T ln 2 · (Σeff + Hreg )

(43)

At T = 310 K and P ≈ 20 W, the available bit-rate floor is P/(kB T ln 2) ≈ 6.74 ×
1021 bits/s, easily covering observed Hreg ∼ 102 bits/s with vast maintenance headroom.
Biological systems actively invest energy in coherence preservation (ATP-driven ion pumps,
synaptic homeostasis) that prevents decoherence without irreversible information production,
keeping effective Σeff well within budget.

6.2

Intelligence as Thermodynamic Optimization

Intelligence maximizes information throughput per unit energy:

Information gain from collapse at coherence r (heuristic from circular statistics):

Igain (r) ≈ − log2 (1 − r2 )

(45)

Power scaling: Total metabolic cost

(46)

where fc is carrier frequency, cmaint is maintenance cost per oscillator-Hz (units: W/Hz
per oscillator), ccoll is dimensionless collapse frequency parameter. For cortex: N ∼ 1010
neurons, fc ∼ 40 Hz (gamma), τcoherence ∼ 0.1 s gives P ∼ 20 W (observed).

Symbolic Codes Emerge at Boundaries

7.1

From Continuous Geometry to Discrete Symbols

Discrete symbols—DNA base pairs, neural population codes, linguistic structures, digital
representations—do not exist during constraint geometry evolution. They emerge at dimensional collapse events when high-D continuous dynamics project onto low-D measurement.
Mechanism: When oscillators form stable resonant configurations (attractors in the
energy landscape E(ϕ)), noise-induced transitions between attractors create discrete symbol
sequences from continuous dynamics.
Transition rates follow Arrhenius form:


∆Emn
Γm→n ∝ exp −
kB T


(47)

where ∆Emn is the energy barrier between attractor states m and n. This creates Markov
processes on symbol space—but symbols are shadows of underlying coherence, not fundamental units.

7.2

Why Symbols Are Not Primary

Intelligence operates at the coherent level (hprod
= 0, high-dimensional constraint evolution).
ε
Symbols emerge only when:

 Memory consolidation: Long-term storage requires stable discrete states resistant
to noise. Attractors with deep energy wells (∆E ≫ kB T ) provide error-correcting
codes.
47

 Communication: Transmitting information between agents requires collapse to discrete tokens. Spoken words, written text, neural spike patterns all represent dimensional reduction to low-D symbols.

 Deliberation: Symbolic reasoning (logic, language) operates on collapsed representations. But the solution generation happens in continuous constraint geometry before
symbolic formulation.
Symbol grounding resolution: Symbols are grounded in the physical coherence from
which they emerge through collapse. This resolves the classical symbol-grounding problem: symbols are not arbitrary labels mapped onto meaning, but stable projections of highdimensional geometric structure onto measurement-accessible subspaces.

7.3

Examples Across Scales

Evolutionary origin: This framework suggests discrete symbolic codes emerge systematically across evolutionary time. Chemical oscillators (e.g., Belousov-Zhabotinsky reactions)
exhibit high-dimensional continuous dynamics. Charged molecular species naturally couple
via electric fields—ephaptic coupling at the chemical level—enabling collision-free exploration of constraint space. Abiogenesis may occur when such oscillators develop defense
mechanisms (the first ”behavioral collapse”—move toward/away, consume/avoid). DNA
emerges not as the computation substrate but as the storage medium: discrete codes that
preserve solutions across dimensional collapse events (replication, cell division). Computation happens in continuous bioelectric geometry; DNA is what you get when you collapse
that to transmissible codes.
DNA base pairs: Four-letter genetic code emerges from resonance-stabilized molecular
configurations (hydrogen bonding patterns). The continuous molecular dynamics (1012 –
1015 Hz vibrations) collapse to discrete A/T/G/C states upon measurement (sequencing,
replication). Information exists geometrically in 3D molecular structure; symbols emerge at
48

chemical readout.
Neural population codes: Place cells, grid cells, concept neurons represent discrete
categories. But these emerge from high-dimensional constraint geometry in neural populations. A ”place cell” firing represents dimensional collapse of high-D constraint geometry
(theta-gamma coupling across hippocampal-entorhinal circuits) onto low-D readout (spike
train). The geometry encodes spatial relationships; the symbol (spike pattern) emerges at
behavioral collision.
Linguistic structures: Words are discrete symbols. But language production involves
continuous articulatory dynamics (tongue/lip trajectories) and continuous semantic space
navigation (meaning as high-D vector). Phonemes emerge as stable attractors in articulatory
phase space; meaning emerges from collapse of semantic constraint geometry onto discrete
word choices.
Digital computation: Bits are enforced symbols—every clock cycle collapses continuous voltage trajectories onto {0, 1}. The symbol is primary by design, not emergence.
This is why digital computation requires continuous collision resolution: symbols must be
maintained against drift into continuous space.

7.4

Information Content: Geometric vs. Symbolic

The information capacity of a code depends on whether it exists geometrically or symbolically:
Symbolic (collapsed):
Isymbolic = log2 (Nsymbols )

(48)

For N discrete states, logarithmic capacity. DNA with 4 bases: 2 bits per site.
Geometric (pre-collapse):
Igeom ∝ log2 Deff

(49)

Capacity scales with effective dimensionality, potentially ≫ log2 (Nsymbols ) because timing
49

relationships encode structure inaccessible to symbolic projection.
Example: Neural ”place cell” firing (symbolic) carries ∼ 3 bits (distinguishing ∼ 8 discrete locations). But the underlying theta-gamma phase code (geometric) carries ∼ 102 bits
through precise timing relationships across Deff ∼ 103 oscillators. The geometric representation is information-rich; the symbolic collapse is information-lossy but robust.

7.5

Evolutionary Advantage of Codes

Why do biological systems use discrete codes (DNA, neural spikes) if continuous geometry is
more information-rich? The emergence and function of biological codes—discrete symbolic
systems mapping between independent domains—is a central question in code biology [25].
Robustness: Discrete attractors with ∆E ≫ kB T resist thermal noise. Error rates
∼ exp(−∆E/kB T ) can be made arbitrarily small by deepening energy wells. DNA basepairing stability (∆E ∼ 10kB T ) gives error rate ∼ 10−4 per replication.
Long-term storage: Continuous dynamics decay through decoherence (τc ∼ ms–s for
neural oscillations). Discrete symbols stabilized in deep attractors persist indefinitely (DNA
stable for 103 –106 years).
Reliable communication: Transmitting continuous waveforms requires high signal-tonoise ratio. Discrete symbols tolerate noise via error-correcting codes (Hamming distance,
redundancy).
Compositionality: Discrete symbols enable combinatorial reuse (DNA codons → proteins, phonemes → words, logic gates → circuits). Continuous geometry resists such decomposition.
The optimal strategy: compute in continuous geometry, store/communicate via
discrete codes. This is exactly what biological systems do. Neural computation operates in high-D constraint geometry; results collapse to discrete symbols (spikes, behaviors)
for transmission/storage. DNA encodes genetic information discretely, but gene expression
operates through continuous molecular dynamics.
50

Crucially, discrete codes need not fully collapse continuous structure. Temporal
dynamics within symbol sequences can encode analog information. Spoken language transmits meaning through discrete phonemes, but prosody, timing, and rhythm carry additional
continuous structure. Consider: whatsthekeytocomedytiming. The discrete symbolic content is identical to its properly spaced version, but the continuous temporal geometry—the
pauses, the rhythm—carries the meaning. Even written text has its own pace and timing,
formed by the dynamics of the reader’s parsing. Neural spike trains, DNA transcription timing, and motor action sequences all exploit this principle: robust discrete transmission with
analog modulation through temporal structure. Codes provide noise-resistant scaffolding;
geometry flows through the timing.

Discussion

8.1

Resolution of the VAS Paradox

Biological systems solve VAS problems efficiently not by finding faster enumeration algorithms but by changing computational substrate. High-dimensional exploration in timinginaccessible regimes (Deff ≫ Dcrit ) permits parallel constraint satisfaction without discrete
state transitions.
The key: temporal decomposition required for discrete algorithms is physically prohibited when measurement capacity cannot track constraint geometry
reconfiguration rate. VAS reachability becomes tractable because the problem cannot be
collapsed into sequential steps without destroying the computation.

8.2

Comparison with Digital Computing

Digital clocked systems enforce Deff /Dcrit ∼ 1 by design: every register is observable every
cycle. This enables debugging and deterministic control but requires Hreg ≈ fc , paying
Landauer cost continuously.

Biological systems achieve Deff /Dcrit ∼ 103 –104 by maintaining coherent dynamics in
regimes where internal state is fundamentally unmeasurable. Collisions occur only at behavioral outputs, minimizing Hreg and power dissipation.
Neuromorphic systems (Loihi, SpiNNaker) occupy intermediate regime with event-driven
collisions, achieving Deff /Dcrit ∼ 10–102 and power ∼ 1 W.

8.3

Relationship to Existing Frameworks

Integrated Information Theory: Posits consciousness scales with integrated information
Φ. Heuristically:
Φ ∝ Deff · r2

(50)

suggesting cognitive processes require both high dimensionality and coherence. Empirically, tachypsychia (subjective time dilation during acute stress) shows dissociation: subjective time slows while reaction times remain unchanged [8]. This dissociation implies phenomenal temporal experience may correlate with high-dimensional pre-commit coherent dynamics (perception) rather than low-dimensional motor commit events (action)—consistent
with consciousness tracking continuous constraint geometry operating beyond Dcrit . However, detailed predictions about subjective experience remain beyond the scope of this work,
which focuses on measurable computational and energetic signatures.
Free Energy Principle: Systems minimize prediction error [21]. Our framework adds:
in timing-inaccessible regimes (Deff ≫ Dcrit ), prediction occurs through constraint geometry evolution inaccessible to external measurement. Active inference operates on collapsed
outputs, not internal dynamics.
52

Developmental Bioelectricity: Levin’s work demonstrates bioelectric gradients coordinate morphogenesis across scales. Ephaptic coupling in neural computation (Miller
et al.) and bioelectric fields in development are manifestations of the same physical phenomenon—electric fields mediating information transfer without discrete synaptic/chemical
transmission. Field-mediated computation may implement high-dimensional constraint geometry at cellular/tissue level, extending the framework beyond neural systems.

8.4

Implications for Artificial Intelligence

Current AI operates in fully measurable digital regimes with Deff /Dcrit ∼ 1. Large language
models achieve dimensional scaling (Deff ∼ 104 in embedding spaces) but through spatial
parameters, not temporal structure, and with every activation observable.
Next generation: Analog neuromorphic substrates enabling timing-inaccessible computation could achieve:

 10 –10 × power efficiency through sparse collisions
 Tractability for VAS-like problems via high-dimensional exploration
 Novel computational modes inaccessible to digital systems
2

3

Thermodynamic computing: Extropic’s probabilistic hardware implements EnergyBased Models via stochastic CMOS circuits, reporting order-of-magnitude energy efficiency
gains over GPUs on specific image generation benchmarks (e.g., Fashion-MNIST). By operating closer to continuous thermodynamic dynamics rather than fully discrete symbolic
updates, such systems may approach intermediate Deff /Dcrit regimes (∼ 10–102 ), trading
deterministic observability for computational efficiency.
The barrier: accepting that the most powerful computations may resist inspection. Intelligence emerges at boundaries of knowability.

Conclusion

We establish intelligence as the capacity to maintain high-dimensional coherent dynamics
that evolve collision-free until sparse behavioral outputs. When Deff ≫ Dcrit , systems solve
computationally intractable problems through high-dimensional exploration in constraint
geometry, paying thermodynamic costs only at discrete decision points rather than at every
computational step.
Key results:
1. Observable Dimensionality Bound: Deff > Dcrit = Cobs τe /(αhtrack
) defines regimes
ε
where timing information is physically inaccessible
2. Dimensional Tracking Bound (Theorem 1): Tracking systems with Dtarget > Dobs
requires collision cost ∼ k Dtarget −Dobs , proving intelligence must be high-dimensional to
avoid exponential thermodynamic penalties
3. Code Formation from Dimensional Mismatch (Theorem 2): When high-D
systems interact through low-D channels, stable symbolic codes must form at boundaries as thermodynamic necessity—explaining language, concepts, and communication
protocols as inevitable consequences of dimensional compression
4. VAS tractability: Discrete reachability remains Ackermann-complete, but highdimensional relaxations replace combinatorial path enumeration with dynamics governed by spectral gap/mixing time, explaining practical tractability in biological regimes
5. Power scaling: P ∝ Hreg explains the two–three orders of magnitude biological
efficiency through sparse collisions
MEG
6. Worked examples: Cortex operates at Deff
/Dcrit ∼ 102 (conservative); substrate

scales plausibly reach 103 –104 , enabling complex computation at ∼ 20 W

54

7. Testable predictions: Coherence times, collapse signatures, dimensional scaling all
measurable without accessing unmeasurable interior dynamics
The deep principle: high-dimensional coherent states encode constraints in geometric
relationships that evolve collision-free, collapsing to discrete outputs only at decision boundaries. This enables both power efficiency (paying Landauer costs only at sparse behavioral
events) and computational tractability (exploring exponentially large state spaces through
continuous dynamics rather than discrete enumeration). A consequence of high-dimensional
operation is that temporal microstructure becomes physically unmeasurable—measurement
capacity cannot track individual mode trajectories when Deff ≫ Dcrit .
Intelligence operates at the boundary between continuous and discrete computation—
maintaining constraint geometry with hprod
= 0 (no entropy production during exploration),
ε
collapsing to discrete outputs only when behavioral demands require it, achieving remarkable
efficiency by decoupling internal dynamics from observable registration rate.
This suggests future computing architectures: systems that maintain high-dimensional
coherent dynamics between sparse readout events, exploiting continuous constraint evolution
to escape the power costs and local minima that trap fully discrete systems. The most
powerful computations may be those that resist step-by-step inspection, operating through
continuous geometry rather than discrete logic.
